Why BushSearch was developed

BushSearch was developed to aid the informal learning of Bushcraft. Bushcraft is the use and practice of skills that allow oneâ€™s survival in a natural environment. The application targets adults in the United Kingdom(UK) interested in learning Bushcraft in their own time outside the formal educational system.
